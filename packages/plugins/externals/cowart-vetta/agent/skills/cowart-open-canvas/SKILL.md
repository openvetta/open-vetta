# Cowart Open Canvas (Vetta 1:1)

## Host mapping

| Codex | Vetta |
|-------|--------|
| MCP App widget (`ui://widget/...`) | Activity panel tab with full tldraw `App` |
| `window.cowartMcp` bridge | Plugin installs the same bridge via `ctx.fs` + `conversation.sendPrompt` |
| Canvas files under project | `<projectDir>/canvas/` (shared with MCP tools) |

## Workflow

1. Call plugin tool `open_cowart_canvas` (opens the Cowart activity tab at max width).
2. Optionally call MCP `render_cowart_canvas_widget` with `projectDir` = **user workspace** to confirm storage paths.
3. Canvas data:

```text
canvas/cowart-canvas.json
canvas/pages/<page-id>/cowart-canvas.json
canvas/pages/<page-id>/assets/
canvas/cowart-selection.json
canvas/cowart-view-state.json
```

4. User draws/annotates in the panel. Agent uses MCP tools (`get_cowart_*`, `insert_cowart_image`, …) for programmatic canvas IO. UI AI actions send follow-up prompts into the active conversation.

## Image tools (when UI / user asks for bitmaps)

| Intent | Tool |
|--------|------|
| New image | **`generate_image`** |
| Edit / annotation revise | **`edit_image`** |

Then place with MCP `insert_cowart_image`. Do not use an `imagegen` skill.

## Constraints

- Never pass the plugin install directory as `projectDir`.
- Prefer `open_cowart_canvas` for the interactive UI; MCP tools remain available for agent-side canvas edits.
