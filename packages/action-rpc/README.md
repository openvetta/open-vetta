# @vetta/action-rpc

Localhost HTTP JSON RPC transport for Vetta Desktop capabilities.

This package owns transport, protocol, server, and client helpers only. It does
not define desktop-app business capabilities.

The server supports independently registered namespaces on one authenticated
endpoint:

- `actions.*` for regular app actions.
- `debug.*` for development-only debug capabilities.

`startActionRpcServer()` remains as the action-only compatibility wrapper.
