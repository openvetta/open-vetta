# im-gateway

> Drive your local vetta coding-agent from IM platforms (Feishu first).

Bridges instant messaging platforms (Feishu, with Telegram / DingTalk planned) to a locally running [`coding-agent`](../coding-agent) instance. Lets you talk to your local AI from your phone or desktop IM client without opening the desktop app, while keeping all code, tools, and credentials on your machine.

## Deployment model

`im-gateway` is **embedded** as a sidecar inside `Vetta.app`. End users do **not** install or configure this binary directly — they enable IM bridging from `Settings → IM 集成` in the desktop app, fill in their feishu credentials, and the desktop main process spawns this binary as a child process.

The sidecar's lifecycle is strictly bound to the desktop app: completely quitting Vetta (including the tray icon) terminates the sidecar and stops receiving feishu events. There is no `launchd` / `systemd` daemon mode, by design.

## Subcommands

| Subcommand | Audience | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | **End users** (driven by desktop-app) | Embedded mode. Reads NDJSON config from stdin, emits NDJSON events on stdout. Lifecycle bound to parent process. No filesystem state. |
| `start` | Developers | Standalone mode. Reads `~/.vetta/im-gateway/config.yaml`. Useful for local debugging of router / bridge / transport without running the full desktop app. |
| `init` | Developers | Generate yaml config templates for `start` mode. |
| `status` / `logs` | Developers | Inspect a running `start`-mode process. |

The `host` subcommand is the only one wired into the user deployment path. Everything else exists for hacking on im-gateway internals.

## Status

**Pre-alpha.** First milestone focuses on personal mode plus Feishu, with the desktop app embedding `im-gateway` as a sidecar.

## How it works

```

                    ~/.vetta/im-gateway/         ~/.vetta/conversation/
                    state.json                   .vetta/sessions/<id>.jsonl
                    config.yaml                  (shared with desktop-app's
                                                  default "对话" project)
```

- **All IM sessions live in `~/.vetta/conversation`** — the same default "对话" project desktop-app uses, so a conversation started in IM shows up in the desktop sidebar (with an "IM" badge) and vice-versa. No `/projects` / `/use` switching.
- **Same session files** as the desktop app — pick up a conversation in IM, continue it on your laptop, single-writer enforced via the `<file>.lock` protocol added to `SessionManager`
- **Routes by `(im_user, chatID)`** — private chat and group chat are independent sessions for the same user
- **Process pool** keyed by absolute session path; LRU eviction; one subprocess per active conversation
- **Transport interface** so adding telegram / dingtalk later is purely additive

## First-milestone scope (Non-Goals)

- ❌ Group chat (private chat first; groups in a follow-up change)
- ❌ Image / file attachments
- ❌ Enterprise / multi-tenant mode (interface preserves the extension point)
- ❌ Windows (macOS + linux first)
- ❌ Modifying `desktop-app` / `coding-agent` / `api`
