// `coding-agent --mode rpc` as a subprocess on the same machine. A future
// remote implementation could connect to a centrally hosted server that
// proxies to a desktop installation over a reverse channel — the upper
// layers (router, bridge) would not change.

	// MUST NOT register a pending entry for cmd.ID — doing so would leak
	// a goroutine waiting on a channel that never resolves.
