# @vetta/desktop-app

Electron desktop host for the Vetta runtime.

## What It Owns

- Electron main/preload/renderer wiring
- desktop-specific IPC bridges
- file explorer, scheduler, project, and chat renderer domains
- integration of runtime packages into a desktop shell

## What It Does Not Own

- provider protocol implementations
- core agent loop logic
- business backend rules

## Who Depends On It

- end users running the desktop application

## Internal Boundaries

- `src/main`: Electron main process and native capabilities
- `src/preload`: safe bridge surface for the renderer
- `src/renderer`: React application domains and UI

## Development

Run `bun dev` from this package after installing the monorepo dependencies. The development startup
builds changed workspace prerequisites, stages plugin and theme manifests, then starts the renderer,
theme server, and Electron process in parallel.

Main-process sourcemaps are disabled by default to keep startup builds fast. Set
`VETTA_MAIN_SOURCEMAP=true` when source-mapped Electron stack traces are needed.

## Electron E2E (WebdriverIO)

Uses WebdriverIO + `@wdio/electron-service` (see `wdio.conf.ts`, `e2e/`).

```bash
# 1) Build main / preload / renderer artifacts
bun run build

# 2) Unpackaged smoke (default: dist/main/index.js)
bun run test:e2e

# Or smoke against electron-builder unpacked binary
bun run pack:win:test   # or pack:linux:test / platform equivalent
bun run test:e2e:packaged
```

Runtime sets `VETTA_E2E=1`, `VETTA_CONFIG_DIR=.vetta-e2e`, and isolates Chromium profile under `.wdio-electron-user-data`.
Day-to-day agent UI verification still uses repo-root `verify:ui:*` (Playwright); this suite targets formal E2E / CI.

Current `e2e/smoke.e2e.ts` batch-1 covers boot only: main-process ready/version, main window `index.html`, config/userData isolation, and a `dialog` mock probe. It does not cover login, chat, or other product flows.
