/**
 * Resolve the absolute path to the im-gateway sidecar binary for the
 * current platform/arch.
 *
 * In packaged builds the binary lives under
 *   <Resources>/im-gateway/im-gateway-<os>-<arch>[.exe]
 *
 * In dev mode (`!app.isPackaged`) we fall back to
 *   <packages>/im-gateway/dist/im-gateway-<os>-<arch>[.exe]
 *
 * The dev path assumes you've run `make cross-build` inside
 * packages/im-gateway/. We resolve relative to `process.cwd()`, which is
 * `packages/desktop-app` when running via `bun run dev` (the same trick
 * main.ts uses to compute appRoot in dev mode). Going one level up lands
 * in `packages/`. Note: `app.getAppPath()` is unreliable in dev mode
 * because Electron treats the entry script's directory (dist/main) as
 * the app dir, not the directory containing package.json.
 *
 * Throws if the resolved path does not exist on disk so the caller can
 * surface a precise error to the user instead of failing later in spawn.
