This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android.

* [/shared](./shared/src) is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - [commonMain](./shared/src/commonMain/kotlin) is for code that’s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, [androidMain](./shared/src/androidMain/kotlin) holds the Android-specific `actual`
    implementations of the `expect` declarations in `commonMain`.

* [/androidApp](./androidApp/src) is the Android application entry point.

### Running the app

- Android app: `./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug`

### Running tests

Use the run button in your IDE's editor gutter, or run tests using Gradle tasks:

- Android tests: `./gradlew :shared:testAndroidHostTest`
